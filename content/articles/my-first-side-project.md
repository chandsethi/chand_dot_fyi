Made this for three reasons:
1. Try antigravity. This site was opus 4.5 for planning, gemini flash 3 for execution (with some micromanagement)

2. I wanted somewhere I could write in public, with no engagement metrics

3. Everyone's vibe coding their personal website, mimicing an existing interface (alanagoyal - notes app, for example). I picked twitter bcs thats where my I spend 2h/day
