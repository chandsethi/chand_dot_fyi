# Why I'm building this

I've always loved the Twitter UI. It's clean, fast, and optimized for content consumption. 

## The Vision
I wanted a place where I could share short thoughts, highlights of things I've read, and longer articles without the friction of a heavy CMS.

### What's next?
- [x] Static shell
- [x] Profile header
- [x] Tweets tab
- [ ] Articles rendering
- [ ] Dark mode

Stay tuned for more updates!
